/*
To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

mkdir NFT-Collection
cd NFT-Collection
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

npx hardhat
Make sure you select Create a Javascript Project and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup.

In the same terminal now install @openzeppelin/contracts as we would be importing Openzeppelin's ERC721Enumerable Contract in our CryptoDevs contract.

npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

Now let's install dotenv package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at hardhat-tutorial directory and execute this command

when youre done

npm install dotenv
 QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL="add-quicknode-http-provider-url-here"

PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-private-key-here"


Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at hardhat-tutorial directory and execute this command

npx hardhat compile
To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at hardhat-tutorial directory and execute this command

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
Save the Crypto Devs Contract Address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it futher down in the tutorial.
